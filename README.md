# Hi, I'm Hidaya 👋

### Data Analyst | Marketing Background | QA Problem Solver | Combat Sports Enthusiast

I started my journey in **marketing**, where I learned to understand user behavior and how data can drive decisions.  
Later, I trained myself in **QA testing**, which improved my **attention to detail, structure, and analytical mindset**.

Today, I’m focusing on **Data Analysis**, working with:
- SQL  
- Excel  
- Data Visualization  
- (Learning) Python Basics  

I enjoy **transforming raw data into clear and useful insights** that actually help teams make decisions.

### 🔥 What I’m working on
- Building real-world mini data projects
- Improving my SQL and data cleaning workflows
- Creating dashboards to make insights visual and simple

### 🥋 A bit about me
I practice **judo, karate, and MMA** — it teaches me:
- Discipline in learning
- Patience when problem-solving
- And to **never give up**… even when a dataset wants to fight 😄
